<p>As a motivated problem solver and diligent learner, I have developed proficiency in the areas of computer programming, CAD design, and problem solving. I have built several projects in a team atmosphere. These projects include building a Fully functioning FM Receiver, Level 1 high powered rocket, and a Face tracking security camera. Currently, I am working with a team to build a robot that can navigate a maze for a class project. I am a previous sub-team leader for the avionics section on the Space City Rocketry team here at the University of Houston and currently the Vice President the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics University of Houston Chapter. I contributed to my Avionics team by performing tests to analyze the stress, vibrations resistance, and heat capability of the new avionics bay we designed. Eventually, my analysis and testing contributed to design changes that mitigated potential issues such as the structural integrity of the bay. As Vice President of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics at the University of Houston, my responsibilities cover being responsible for managing the organization in the absence of the President, recruitment activities, and serves as the liaison between the organization and all other organizations within University of Houston system. As an active member of The American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics community, I have developed the necessary interpersonal skills to succeed in a dynamic work environment. As a previous Public Relations Officer for the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics at the University of Houston, I effectively communicated changes to the organization they need to make to solve Public Relation problems and help grow The American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics community effectively.</p>
